Tech Writing Exercise 1: (20 min)
Write part of a tutorial that includes an introduction and two sections for a manual on how to
use a DVR. Instructions should be well-organized and clear. Since reading instruction manuals
can be boring, try to liven things up through good organization, enthusiasm, or maybe even
humor.
● Introduction: Summarize the content in the sections that follow.
● Section 1: Explain DVR playback (including play, stop, pause, fast-forward, and rewind).
● Section 2: Explain how to record a TV show.

-> Considerations

I have never used a DVR before!!! I have no idea how it works... I will have to research a little first and come up with a solution to finish it on time. I will probably have to create some of the commands.

???Do I want to be funny? Is it going to be good for the text, will I look more approachable if I try to lighten things up with some humor?

1
-Introduction congratulating the customer for buying the product.
-what is a dvr and its advantages.
Section 1
-I will suppose the user has already set up the device etc.
-tell users about the basic functions.
-use pictures to point to the buttons of a controller and explain what they do (maybe it will take too much time)
-It should be simple.
Section 2
-some screenshots to show users how to record a tv show. I don't think I have time to make something this elaborate. Maybe some unordered items in a list.

???Am I allowed to use images?
