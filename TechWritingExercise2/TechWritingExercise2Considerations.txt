Tech Writing Exercise 2: (20 min)
Sometimes, documentation is submitted by those for whom English is a challenging
communication medium. You may also be called upon to edit a peer’s documentation. We call
this “wordsmithing.”
Below is a real-world example of documentation submitted by a non-native English speaking
writer. To the best of your ability, please wordsmith this documentation so that it is clear,
concise, and understandable. Hint: your word count when finished should be lower than the
original text

-> Considerations
well... let's see what I can do with what I got.
??? do I have to format the text as well?
It is all broken when I copy from the pdf. I should find a way to import it to .doc and then copy it.
??? do I alter part of the essence of the text?
I will rewrite part of it and use part of it. I need to check for grammar, spelling, word order, vocabulary usage, and other things.
