# TechWritingExercises
Hi JR and Rich,

Thank you once again for this opportunity!
Here are the Technical Writing exercises. I hope you don't mind that I used git to organize my files. It is easier this way. I have separated the exercises into folders, each containing an .md file with the answers, a .txt file with the exercise prompt and some considerations I made before and during the exercises, and, in Exercise 3, a .java file to simulate the Javadoc.

I hope I can hear from you guys soon.

Best regards,
Eric T. H. Moritsuka
