Tech Writing Exercise 3: Javadoc (15 min)

The insert(...) method below needs Javadoc. The behavior of the method is demonstrated as follows ...


String s = "happy day";

System.out.println(StringUtil.insert(s, " birth", 6)); // prints "happy birthday"

System.out.println(StringUtil.insert(null, " birth", 6)); // prints "null"


Fill in the Javadoc for the insert(...) method. Use the Liferay Javadoc Guidelines as a reference.



/**

*

*

*

*	@param s

*	

*	@param insert

*	

*	@param offset

*	

*	@return

*

*/

public static String insert(String s, String insert, int offset)

{

...

}


-> Considerations
I have to read about writing Javadoc. I will use the guidelines provided to see if there is an example there.
Do I write the .java file or do I place it in the .md file?
Do I write the example of the function working in the Javadoc or was it just to understand its use?
